# Maine Wildfire Analysis

An analysis of wildfire activity in Maine using open data from national and state sources.  
This project demonstrates how to pull, process, and visualize wildfire perimeter and county boundary data using **GeoPandas**, and generate both static figures and interactive outputs.

## 📌 Overview

Wildfires are an important environmental and land management issue in Maine, a heavily forested state with hundreds of fire events annually. This repository provides scripts and outputs to explore wildfire patterns, map fire perimeters, and generate geospatial visualizations.

Data sources used:
- **National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)** – Wildfire perimeter data  
  https://data-nifc.opendata.arcgis.com/
- **OpenDataSoft** – County boundary data
