# Data Directory

This directory contains spatial datasets used in the **Maine Wildfire Analysis (2022)** project.  
To promote reproducibility and respect data licensing constraints, raw source data is **not included**
in the repository and must be downloaded separately.

## 📂 Directory Structure

```
data/
├── raw/ # Original, unmodified datasets from external sources
├── processed/ # Cleaned or derived datasets generated by analysis scripts

## 📥 Raw Data (`raw/`)

The `raw/` folder is intended to store original datasets exactly as downloaded.
These files should not be manually edited.

**Raw data is excluded from version control** due to file size and licensing considerations.

## 🔄 Processed Data (`processed/`)

The `processed/` folder is reserved for datasets created during analysis, such as:
- reprojected layers
- spatially joined datasets
- aggregated county-level summaries

Processed datasets may be regenerated at any time by running the analysis scripts in `src/`.

## 📌 Notes on Reproducibility

To reproduce this analysis:

1. Download the raw datasets from the sources listed above
2. Place them in the `data/raw/` directory
3. Run the main analysis script (`src/main.py`)

All spatial data is projected to **EPSG:2802 (Maine State Plane)** during processing to ensure
consistent spatial analysis and accurate area-based calculations.
